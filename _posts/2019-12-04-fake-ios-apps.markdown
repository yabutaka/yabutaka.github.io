During the first year of college, I enrolled in [iOS specialization at Code Path](https://codepath.org/), a bootcamp on iOS development. The 10-week-program taught me how to make a fake Instagram app and a fake Twitter app. Here are the clips showing the apps.

Parstagram is a simplified version of Instagram. This app uses Parse as the database, and log-in and other basic features of Instagram are implemented. <a href="https://github.com/yabutaka/Parstagram">Check the repository on GitHub from this link.</a>

Flixster is a movie recommendation app. You can scroll movies and click a movie to check the detail. This app uses a movie database API. <a href="https://github.com/yabutaka/flixster">Check the repository on GitHub from this link.</a>
